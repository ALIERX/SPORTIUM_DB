# üîß SPORTIUM - Troubleshooting Guide

## Signup Errors

### Error: "Email already registered"

**Cause:** The email you're trying to use already has an account.

**Solutions:**
1. Use the **Sign In** tab instead of Sign Up
2. Try a different email address
3. If you forgot your password, contact support (password reset coming soon)

### Error: "Database error creating new user"

**Cause:** Supabase Auth configuration issue or the user already exists.

**Solutions:**
1. Check if the email is already registered using the Debug Panel
2. Try using a completely new email address
3. Check server logs in the Debug Panel

### Error: "Failed to create profile" or "Failed to create wallet"

**Cause:** KV Store connectivity issue.

**Solutions:**
1. Click "Check Server Health" in Debug Panel
2. Verify KV status shows "connected"
3. If KV is disconnected, check Supabase dashboard

**Response:**
```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "exists": true  // true = already registered
}
```

- Enter an email in the input field (or leave blank for random)
- Click "Test Signup"
- Creates a test user account

**Successful response:**
```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",

    "success": true,
    "user": { ... }
  }
}

## FAQ

**Q: Why do I get "Email already registered" but I never signed up?**
A: Someone might have tested with your email. Try using a different email or add `+test` to your Gmail (e.g., `yourname+test@gmail.com`).

**Q: Can I reset my password?**
A: Password reset is coming soon. For now, use a different email or contact support.

**Q: My account was created but I have 0 FP**
A: The wallet creation step failed. Try signing out and in again. If still 0, the account needs to be recreated.

**Q: I keep getting "Database error"**
A: This usually means:
1. Email already exists (use Sign In instead)
2. Server connectivity issue (check Debug Panel Health)
3. Supabase configuration issue (wait and try again)

## Production Notes

### Before Going Live:

1. **Remove Debug Panel**
   - Delete `<DebugPanel />` from `/App.tsx`
   - Delete `/components/DebugPanel.tsx`

2. **Add Email Verification**
   - Configure email server in Supabase
   - Change `email_confirm: true` to `false` in signup endpoint
   - Add email verification flow

3. **Add Password Reset**
   - Implement forgot password flow
   - Add password reset email template

4. **Add Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent signup spam
   - Add CAPTCHA for signup form

5. **Better Error Messages**
   - Don't expose "email already exists" (security risk)
   - Use generic "signup failed" message
   - Add support contact

---

If you're still having issues:

1. Check all sections above
2. Use Debug Panel to diagnose
